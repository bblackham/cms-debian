CMS - Contest Management System
=================================


Introduction
------------

CMS, or Contest Management System, is a distributed system for running
and (to some extent) organizing a programming contest.

CMS has been designed to be general and to handle many different types
of contests, tasks, scorings, etc. Nonetheless, CMS has been
explicitly build to be used in the 2012 International Olympiad in
Informatics, held in September 2012 in Italy.


Support
-------

The complete CMS documentation is at <https://cms.readthedocs.org/>.

The mailing list for announcements, discussion about development and
user support is <contestms@freelists.org>. You can subscribe at
<http://www.freelists.org/list/contestms>.

So far, it is an extremely low traffic mailing list. In the future, we
may consider splitting it in different lists for more specific usage
cases (user support, development, ...).

To help with the troubleshooting, you can collect the complete log
files that are placed in /var/local/log/cms/ (if CMS was running
installed) or in ./log (if it was running from the local copy).


Testimonials
------------

CMS has been used in several official and unofficial contests. In
particular we are aware of the following:

If you used CMS for a contest, selection, or a similar event, and want
